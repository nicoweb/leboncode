A robust API for a product sales platform, inspired by LeBonCoin, with a focus on adhering to best software engineering practices.

## ðŸš§ Status: In Active Development ðŸš§

This project is currently in active development. While its foundational principles and structures are in place, features and functionality may still be in flux.

## Overview

The primary goal is to implement a product sales platform starting from a Symfony skeleton and a given `docker-compose` setup. This project employs methodologies such as:

- **Outside-In TDD**
- **Hexagonal Architecture** to isolate the core of the application from external needs.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to focus on the core domain logic.
- **CQRS** for a clear separation of command and query responsibilities.

Quality assurance tools integrated:

- **PHP-CS-Fixer**: For code style consistency.
- **PHPStan**: For static analysis ensuring bug-free code.
- **Rector**: Automated code refactoring.
- **Deptrac**: Enforces rules to maintain architecture boundaries.

## Features

### Advert Management
- Create, retrieve, update, and delete product advertisements.

## Project Structure

The project is modularized, e.g., `app/Module/User`. Each module can house multiple use-cases, such as "Register User", and these use-cases are categorized as:

- **Application**: Includes query/command, handlers, mappers, etc.
- **Domain**: Houses the core business logic and domain entities.
- **Infrastructure**: Contains details of implementation, like repositories.
- **Presentation**: Manages HTTP requests/responses â€“ controllers, etc.

### Layer Dependencies:

- **Domain**: No dependencies.
- **Application**: Only Domain.
- **Infrastructure**: Vendors and Domain.
- **Presentation**: Vendors and Domain.
